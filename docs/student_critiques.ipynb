    "- **What works:** The visual badges and three-entry table quickly convey course vibe; architecture overview maps code to learning goals which helps me see the scope.\n",
    "- **Confusing:** Quick start references a `.env.example` file that is not in the repo listing; the README also assumes I know which Python version to use.\n",
    "- **Potential defects:** Grading section promises 69 tests at 100% coverage, so any future mismatch could break credibility; Quick Start should probably warn about needing an OpenAI API key with paid access.\n",
    "- **Improvement ideas:** Add a prerequisite callout (Python version, CLI familiarity). Maybe embed a small flowchart linking README sections so I can plan the 2-week journey.\n",
    "- **Questions raised:** Are we supposed to use Claude or GPT tools? README references Claude but repo branding says \n",
